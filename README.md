# Hello! 

I've been a builder 🍀 all my life making systems that work for enterprise, production loads. I am an `avocational` product manager, because enterprise "products" _are_ **the systems we build** to solve problems.

It's a subtle, distinct difference: Individuals buy products, enterprise buys solutions. 

Everything we build has far-reaching effects, and embedded everywhere are APIs to interact with them.

This is a tool for rapidly scaling and iterating on API specifications.

### About:  
- I work in the intersections of programming, performance, and revenue.  
- I am deeply curious about MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH, the way we present and consume information, and natural language processing. 
- I enjoy walking, buskers, cold plunging, '67-'73 Chevy trucks, and Chagaccino!
